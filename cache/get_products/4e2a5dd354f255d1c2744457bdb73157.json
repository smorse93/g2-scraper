Coupled with their great working knowledge of both GP and BC they were able to either match our current processes or improve them based on the new capabilities in BC.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Alta Vista Technology?\nNothing comes to mind. They are very professional and open to discussions if any issues arise.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Alta Vista Technology:\nAsk as many questions as you can and be open to feedback. They are very easy to talk to so the more they know about your company and processes the more advice they can provide.\n\nWhat problems is Alta Vista Technology solving and how is that benefiting you?\nConverting our accounting software from Miscrosoft GP to Microsoft Business Central. We started the project with a different company before switching to Alta Vista about halfway through. I would honestly say that Alta Vista saved the project and turned it from a regret into something I wish we did sooner.",

I can finally scale my business up without fear of overloading my previous, archaic system.\n\nWhat do you like best about Alta Vista Technology?\nHands-on development, on-site training, and simplicity.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Alta Vista Technology?\nTeams meetings. Personally, I found it difficult to effectively communicate my issues. I had to have Mike here to physically show him.\n\nWhat problems is Alta Vista Technology solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI have not been able to grow my business for fear of overloading.
