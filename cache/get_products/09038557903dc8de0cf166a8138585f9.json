It has job offers in all areas of work and that makes it a platform that recommends family and friends who are looking for work.\n\nWhat do you like best about Adecco?\nWhat I like most is the interface is very easy to use\n\nWhat do you dislike about Adecco?\nWhat I like the least is that I have to add a lot of information about previous jobs. It would be good to have some tab to upload your curriculum summary in PDF format\n\nRecommendations to others considering Adecco:\nMy recommendation is that people who use ADDECO have patience and know how to select very well the jobs they really like and are prepared to take on such jobs.",
