Without them, I would be lost!\n\n\nHaving a sales rep that I can contact directly with any question.  That person in turn can navigate the web of contacts to figure out a solution or present several different options.\n\n\nSometimes the offerings of CDW can be confusing.  Vendor relationships change, and there will be no notice outside the organization.\n\n\nAll of our cloud-based solutions are managed via CDW.  This lowers costs due to bulk pricing while providing better services for support.",

We prefer Xerox because we've had much better luck with warranty claims through them vs Dell--and CDW is closely partnered with Xerox and fulfills e-concierge orders.\n\n\nShipping is fast and my sales rep is both knowledgable and courteous. The prices are reasonable, inventory (on current items) is usually good. CDW provides good support for hardware purchased through them and if they don't have the product I need, they often have something similar enough that I can make it work.\n\n\nThe website often lists multiple items with the same model number but slightly different skus, which is confusing. My other primary complaint is that they frequently discontinue models--which then causes toner costs to skyrocket. That might be beyond CDW's control, though.\n\n\nMake sure you get a good sales rep to work with. Companies are only as reliable as your point of contact. Advocate for your company and your needs until they are met--by your rep, or another one. Their staff covers a wide variety of specialties. For example, they have different reps that specialize in large copiers versus small business printers, and it varies from brand to brand as well. If you find a product you like, it's better to buy a few so that you'll have them--as it's likely they will run out or be discontinued at some point, which can make rollouts challenging.\n\n\nWhen I order hardware I know it will be the correct thing, arrive ahead of my expectations, and they will provide support if necessary. We used to purchase small office printers through a local vendor and we were frustrated by their lack of support, as well as their selling us older model discontinued printers that they had leftover stock of without telling us. With CDW I'm always getting the latest products available.",
