It provides a good basic framework to follow, resulting in a more structured sales process.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Action Selling?\nIn my opinion, the curriculum was geared more towards the sale of simple, commodity based products, and isn't as effective for sellers in tech or Saas sales, where the products are more complex, and buyers are more sophisticated.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Action Selling:\nI would ask for references in your specific industry and verify with them that they've had success in implementing the Action Selling process, and that it's led to a higher win rate for their sellers.\n\nWhat problems is Action Selling solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAction Selling provides a basic framework for taking control of the sales process by gaining \"commitment\" from the buyer as you progress through the various stages of the sales funnel.",
