First, management are very unreasonable and have very high expectations. We used to work excessively more hours than expected, especially towards month ends. Their payment is meager in comparison to industry standards and never in time.\n\n\nI can't recommend them to anyone. They are very disappointing!\n\n\nNone. They need a lot of improvements, especially in the management",

We were able to easily find the issues with our database by gaining statistical models and arithmetic information from this tool.\n\n\nThe only issue is that the system was most effective for our internal issues rather than being able to expand to a larger network for data analytics.",
