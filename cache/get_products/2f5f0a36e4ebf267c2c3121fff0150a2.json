                "review_content": "What do you like best about Adit?\nIt is easy to use and figure out. I was able to teach myself to create my own customized new patient forms within a few tries. I also always have the option to send the content that I need made into a form to Adit and they will make it for me.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Adit?\nThe only downside was how long the process took to get the system up and running. The onboarding process was kind of long, but ended up being worth it for sure!\n\nRecommendations to others considering Adit:\nYou need to be willing to spend the time to really learn the software and take advantage of all of its features. Even if just one person is using all of the features in the office, it benefits everybody. It is so comprehensive that it can seem overwhelming and like a lot to learn, but it is a tool and used correctly, can really help the practice.\n\nWhat problems is Adit solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAdit has several features that help me daily. My favorites are the Follow Ups function on Practice Analytics and the Patient Forms. I am able to do all of our new patient paperwork digitally and have reminders automatically sent for me. Not only do I save a lot of paper, but a lot of time by having Adit get the forms filled out for me. The follow ups function keeps sticky notes off of my desk. I am able to put any reminders I need into the follow up function for any team member and assign a date. Everbody checks their follow ups daily so they can see what reminders are in there.",
