Throughout the courtship with a new partner you always wonder if they like you as much as you like them. The feeling was mutual in this case as we each brought very different skill sets to the table to best serve the shared customer.\n\nWhat do you like best about Accenture?\nIt's always great to meet good people who work for cool companies, and it's even better when customers trust them. These guys are trustworthy and professional. Also their willingness to take on a new UX platform as a challenge and learn it and own it stood out to us from other partners we have worked alongside.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Accenture?\nNothing really to dislike about these guys. Maybe ... if I have to answer, they are resistant to having all employees buy Skuid licenses, as well as have all engineering resources take our formalized training program and get certified.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about Accenture?\nThey were very friendly and made sure their contact information was available for us to talk to them as needed. They had a fast turnaround time for the work given to them.They have many skills under their roof. They assigned people on our time zone to work with us.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Accenture?\nWhile they had given us lines of communications they didn't respond to us in a timely manner. When an update was to be delivered there was a non response from the project manager and developer. Emails and phone calls were not returned at all. We had to contact a VP to get back to us and it took a day to get back to us. They were fast to move on working but they missed details of the work needed to be done. For example we needed an excel script made but the developer worked on OSX and the macro did not function as well on Windows. No one else was assigned that could do it natively on Windows, it did not work very smoothly on a Windows computer, an in house person had to fix it.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Accenture:\nThey should look to other vendors as they do not seem to offer very good communication or support. They should demand the people working on their project use the same environment as their own to ensure the work is compatible with the systems. Get contact information from executives and managers of the people you are working with if they become non communicative.\n\nDo your own homework, they offered up solutions that were more expensive to the cost of the project when a little leg work would have solved it without additional cost.",

Cultural activities within the organization is a great initiative.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Accenture?\nThey can improve upon the trainings quality by incorporating qualified trainers also they should try to raise the initial CTC offered to freshers here in India.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Accenture:\nAccenture is a good company for freshers bit i would say experienced candidate should definitely look upon other options while considering to join them as job security has gone down in these years.\n\nWhat problems is Accenture solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI have started my career with Accenture and it was a great experience working with them. Once you are hired as freshers they will enroll you in 2 months trainings as per you module.I will say training was average and it's something they can improve upon.",
