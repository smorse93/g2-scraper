We were able to utilize his knowledge as a coach, an advisor, and an administrator to help us when we hit snags in the road. One of my favorite things during our time were roleplays and coaching conversations around outbound calls. It was great to have an extra set of ears helping you make small tweaks that created a big impact. This helped create confidence and pushed us to overcome call reluctance. He created checkpoints for accountability and helped keep the team moving forward.\n\n\nNot all companies are going to operate the same, and our process and industry need a special approach. I think the internal, historical approach and this new external, consultative approach could've used better alignment during the project. Reps were being coached one way by the external and advised differently by the internal. This led to overall gaps in fitting the new team into the current company mold.\n\n\nSkaled was helping to get our new Business Development team off the ground with a playbook, new rep coaching, and overall process design.",

                "review_content": "When we initially engaged with Skaled, I was a tech-founder with no sales leadership.  Skaled's consultant Jeb acted as interim Head of Sales.  He helped with everything from onboarding AEs, to running our sales process, to eventually helping us evaluate and hire an amazing VP of Sales.  When necessary,  he would bring in other resources inside of Skaled, such as helping us set up Salesforce.\n\n\nJeb's guidance as we scaled up was really helpful.  As we hit different stages from sorting out processes, to hiring and leveling up processes, Jeb (and the Skaled Team) was able to adapt as our business evolved.\n\n\nI don't think this could have been helped, but the only downside was that because Jeb wasn't full-time (and all the financial benefits that entailed), scheduling would sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nPull the trigger on this service sooner than you think.  It will help you avoid many unanticipated problems.\n\n\nWe were focused on building a repeatable sales process, while confirming product-market fit across a couple of very different markets.  Relying on Skaled's experience meant avoiding many mistakes we would have made without them.",

Relevant feedback. Lionel could always be reached on Slack for additional questions, very reliable.\n\n\nCould have used more one-on-one time. Though I believe that falls under contract terms. Our management should have collaborated sooner to create a playbook.\n\n\nI was not involved with the implementation of Skaled's service, so I can't really speak to that. However, as a sales professional collaborating with our Skaled consultant, my experience has been incredible. I've learned more about advanced sales techniques in the last several months than I have in years. I highly recommend partnering with Skaled.\n\n\nLionel is specifically helping me refine my sales techniques. I've been a sales professional for over a decade and didn't realize that I had slowly fallen into bad habits. Some of my techniques also weren't as current as they should have been. He has helped me improve my email structure and tactics. He's helped me streamline and maximize my phone outreach. He absolutely transformed my LinkedIn profile and taught me everything I now know about using social media to engage prospects.",

                "review_content": "As an SDR in a start-up, there aren't many processes in place as to how to prospect. So each rep was doing their own thing and trying to find success with that. Hannah from Skaled came in and really took the time to understand what we were doing, what was working, and what wasn't. She provided so much guidance around how to research prospects, the best sequences to use, how to handle objections, and scripts for cold calling. Before Skaled, I was throwing many prospects into my sequence thinking that I could only be successful if I blasted as many people as I could each week. Now I understand the power of personalization and the process behind it so it doesn't seem as impossible and time-consuming anymore. THANK YOU HANNAH!\n\n\nThe SDR playbook that was written by Skaled and my team is now my bible. I look at it anytime I make a phone call or need to write an email to a persona I'm less familiar with. The coaching sessions were also incredibly helpful. It had me thinking about different ways to approach an email or introductory conversation that I had never thought of before.\n\n\nNot every Skaled rep is great. We had used Skaled before and our first rep just didn't mesh well with our team and the second rep was nice but less hands on. So I think it's important to work with the right person at Skaled who can vibe well with your team and speak to them in a way that resonates.\n\n\nWe are solving all things SDR! Our reps are ramping way faster than I did when I joined without using Skaled, so that's been awesome to see!",

She (Lisa Marks) has been nothing short of indispensable for me.  We meet regularly to discuss operational strategy, personnel, and even executive coaching.  She is also helping me write the sales playbook, rules of engagement, and various marketing elements.  I can't say enough about her work and look forward to continuing our partnership.\n\n\nFlexibility access to an amazing consultant.\n\n\nCould use a little more clarity on all services that Skaled can provide.\n\n\nRedesigning the sales process, comp packages, GTM strategy, etc.  We have received executive level, independent third-party thinking, and validation from someone who has done the job previously.",

They kept us in the loop and the incorporated changes on our end due to a new Global Head of Sales.\n\n\nNothing I can really think of. Consulting engagements can always become muddy and vague, bt we nailed the SOW upfront and executed against it.\n\n\nWe needed to get our SDR function firing, and didn't want to wait for the new SDR manager to get it fixed.  They came in, hit the ground running and kept momentum going.",

This included intake of information from key members of the company the sales team would work for, the implementation of technology-primarily Salsforce.com and SalesLoft, and LinkedIn.  Matt managed the project from the beginning with intake meetings, building sales process steps and plan, the sales playbook which includes a tremendous amount of information collected and assembled in the playbook.  He further trained on the playbook contents, LinkedIn, coordinated technology training, and overall did a great job!\n\n\nMatt's communication skills, both written, verbal, and timely are a real asset.\n\n\nThe time between meetings, some of the missed or rescheduled meetings slowed us down, but that goes both ways.  It would have been helpful to have had Salesforce reports developed, tested, and approved before beginning the actual start date of the program.\n\n\nStay engaged and make sure all internal influencers and decision-makers are engaged and accountable for their involvement, evaluation/review, and approval on each phase of the project.\n\n\nProblems solved included lack of resources in our company so need Skaled expertise in key functions to build and implement the team.  Benefits included a faster implementation, useful materials such as the sales playbook, and a model for future implementations.",
