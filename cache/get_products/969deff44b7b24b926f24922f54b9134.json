They didn't utilize our full contracted services with Intacct, leaving out entire add-ons that we will now cancel on our contract renewal (they recommended these add-ons and then didn't utilize them in the implementation!) Some part is our own fault, we came into the project largely ignorant of what the system could do (we were not experts in a brand new software, go figure) and relied solely on Armanino to help us implement and migrate, which they did finally achieve, but we missed every single deadline and missed our full implementation deadline by months. We still have integrations that are not complete and their development team is largely unresponsive at this point (a year later). There were points in the implementation where they were taking so much time to do things that we asked them to show us how to do it so we could do it for them. The same thing happened with some of the integrations, their team took literally months to throw together a simple integration which was only completed by OUR TEAM in the end. They are order takers and you need know exactly what you want down to the very technical level or your implementation will be a train wreck. They are not trying to fill in the gaps for you or providing advice. A lot of our problems stemmed from our team \"not knowing what we didn't know\" and Armanino making no effort to help us maximize the system. We walked into the implementation saying that we didn't want to directly copy our old system (which was decades old), but we wanted to maximize Intacct in all of its modern glory. Instead, we largely copied our system because the only question they know how to ask is \"How are you doing it now?\"\n\nRecommendations to others considering Armanino:\nFind another company.\n\nWhat problems is Armanino solving and how is that benefiting you?\nArmanino helped facilitate the implementation of a system that has helped us automate several processes and helped us clean up financials, but the way that Armanino went about it was possibly the most inefficient I've ever seen.",

Based on changing need, the recommended Sage Intacct to us in 2016 and implemented the ERP in late 2017. Additionally the company provides consulting support under an annual support agreement.\n\nWhat do you like best about Armanino?\nThe consultants are very knowledgeable about the products they service.  They take time to understand the needs of their customers and offer sound advice.  The consultants are very responsive to  requests for assistance or information and have demonstrated excellent follow up on outstanding issues with the software provider.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Armanino?\nI appreciate the request for dislikes in this survey, but find the \"required\" status for this response unnecessary.  Issues that we have had with TRG, that could constitute a dislike,  were never serious, did not jeopardize our on-going relationship and most importantly, addressed by TRG management.\n\nWhat problems is Armanino solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOur move to Sage Intacct was predicated on a better timesheet system.  The system has worked very well.  Another need was to include project expenses within the General Ledger.  TRG's recommendation has solved this issue.  Sage Intacct is out of the box with no customization, so TRG provides solutions to us to make the system work for our unique requirements.",
