Overall, the engineers are very smart people who are doing their best to make the company succeed. Work Market's office is located 4 short blocks from Penn Station, making commuting a breeze. Free catered lunch is provided once a week, and it's usually pretty good.\n\nWhat do you like best about Agent Anything?\nBrilliant management team. Transparency into everything from hiring decisions to finances. Options for mobility within the organization. Engineers get to work with all the latest tech. Company is growing, addressable market is huge.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Agent Anything?\nSales often oversells the product to customers on pieces of the roadmap they know won't be available for another six months to a year. Customer success managers are more tier 1 support than part of the sales process, they like to just push problems onto engineering.",
