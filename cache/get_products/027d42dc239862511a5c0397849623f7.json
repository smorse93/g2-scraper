They help recommend the correct type of software for our company and how many seats we need for our team. They are knowledgeable about implementing software and recommending training or support for our team. They provide excellent feedback and follow up with us throughout the year, giving us lots of notice when it is time to renew our software licensing and take the time to explain any difference with the new contracts. Their website has a lot of resouces and tutorials that are useful and relavent to our company\n\n\nThey are consistent and keep in touch with us throughout the year, not just when it is time to renew. Provide many resources on their website and offer good training in the software they provide.\n\n\nI have a hard time keeping track of who our current representative is as it seems to change a lot almost mulitiple times a year. In the past, we had a direct connection with a sales representative that visited us and kept in touch with us throughout the year. She had an excellent understanding of our business and wanted to offer us the best solutions. It is a shame we don't have that kind of relationship with our new representative.\n\n\nThey provide a lot of knowledge and resources about the software that would be best suited to your industry and team. They offer resources and training on their website with many webcasts, tutorials and blog posts.\n\n\nThey have helped us choose the right software and figure out how many licenses are appropriate for the size of the team we have. They offered us help and problem-solving for implementing the server aspect of our software and for when we haven't upgraded our software to the latest version in a few years and needed to do a multistep process of different version installations to get our software up and running the latest version.",
