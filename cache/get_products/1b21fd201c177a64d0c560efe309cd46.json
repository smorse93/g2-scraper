                "review_content": "What do you like best about A And F Computersysteme AG?\nThe thing that I liked the best was their customer service. They made sure that they interacted separately with each customers understood what was the specific problems faced by each one of them and gave tailor made solutions for each of them. This means that no two customers have the same solutions. This meant that all of the customers are treated separately and with care which not many others follow. Another thing that I liked about A and F computersysteme AG was their punctuality they delivered the solutions on time everyyime. As a customer we have timelines and when it goes wrong it becomes a problem for business but they made sure that the timelines were kept which was really appreciable.\n\nWhat do you dislike about A And F Computersysteme AG?\nOne of the downsides was the price point as they provide premium services their price point is on the higher side. It would have been better if they had provided a lite option with some of their basic solutions for others to try out. This would have meant that many of the startup companies or companies that are on a budget would be able to try and test their services and if they feel that the services they provide are a great fit to their organization then they can buy the premium solutions completely. However for all the premium services they provide they are way ahead of the competitors and if you have the money then it is definitely worth to go ahead and buy their premium package.\n\nRecommendations to others considering A And F Computersysteme AG:\nIf you have the money to spend and you are looking for a premium solution provider then go for it\n\nWhat problems is A And F Computersysteme AG solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWith the help of A and F Computersysteme AG I was able to get the latest solutions for my various business problems. They made sure that with the help of their products I was able to increase the productivity which meant that I could solve more problems in the given timeframe. With this increase in productivity meant that there was an automatic increase in the revenue that was generated compared to before. I am really happy with the servIce that they provided as it not only increased the revenue but their solutions for the business problems were solved very easily. I would definitely recommend A and F computersysteme AG for others also.",
