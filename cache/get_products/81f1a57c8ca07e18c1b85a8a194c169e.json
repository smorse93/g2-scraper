I have also looked for jobs on their site, which has nice filters and search tools.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Amtec?\nMy only qualm is the lack of adoption at the moment. It would be nice if there were greater job postings on their site. However, the onboarding tools are great.\n\nWhat problems is Amtec solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe process of job searching and onboarding have both been streamlined for me. Its nice to have the process pre-set and all in one place. No chasing different documents,etc",
