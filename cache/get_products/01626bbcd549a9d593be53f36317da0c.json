Before the session, I was asked about what I would be interested in learning more about, then received an email requesting any additional things I might want to ask about in the session. This resulted in a well-organized session with a minimum of on-the-fly questions (though these were encouraged and answered well).\n\nWhat do you dislike about 360 Cloud Solutions?\nMy 2023 vehicle's GPS sent me to the old 360 office in Morrisville. Was 30 minutes late. I view this as Land Rover's fault rather than a 360 issue, but could be problematic for in-person clients. Regarding the training, I had no complaints. Plenty of opportunities for breaks. Great material I can immediately apply to challenges at the day job.\n\nWhat problems is 360 Cloud Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?\nLarge scale datasets within NetSuite coming across integrations is a major component of in-flight projects. The examples of map/reduce application shown within the training can vastly simplify the project plan.  I also own some processes on scheduled/restarting scripts that take up to 40 minutes. These could also be made more efficient.",
