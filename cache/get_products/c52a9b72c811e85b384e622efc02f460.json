We have great faith in them and their abilities to safeguard our critical data and develop a solution that will help us succeed. Bluewolf's crew is adaptable, communicative, and professional. His background was obvious, as was his familiarity with Salesforce and AccountingSeed. Our team was really pleased with how well the Bluewolf team collaborated with us. A important element for me is that they keep the project moving, keep me continually updated, and give regular and comprehensive progress communication. His thinking leadership and drive aided us in developing the finest possible solution for our company.\n\n\nThere isn't much to \"dislike\" about us. Working with Bluewolf has been a very pleasant and productive experience. In terms of the AccountingSeed project, we had nothing but positive things to say about Bluewolf; they were responsive throughout the collaboration.\n\n\nThis is the product and people to make it happen for any business that wants to take it to the next level. Bluewolf may be trusted since they have experience in a variety of sectors and will listen to your specific wants and rules. Bluewolf provided an appropriate solution for us because they understand how important time is to our organization. They take the time to understand your business requirements and tailor the solution to those requirements, all while keeping the project organized and on track.\n\n\nWe lacked the capacity to integrate our ERP, Finance, Accounts, and other systems. Our data was spread across many platforms, making it difficult to maintain efficiency. Basic chores become too difficult and time-consuming. Our everyday duties have been simplified and linked. Our workers and clients can now interact more efficiently, and all of our data is in one location. We were able to build automation with Salesforce to speed up typical activities, and we can now instantaneously access our accounting information in one coherent system.",

While I found IBM's team a little stuffy initially, they came around through longer conversations and it was clear that they hire people committed to knowing their industry well.\n\n\nThey steer you rather strongly toward their own solutions, which I sometimes found lacking. Obviously, they believe in their tech, but if I've already told them that I prefer a different solution, they should work that into our project and not keep insisting that we bring their solutions in. I found this disrespectful.\n\n\nIBM Consulting Services is a solid choice for companies looking for experienced and knowledgeable consultants. Their team has a wealth of industry expertise and they are able to provide valuable insights and guidance to clients. However, while they are reliable and competent, they may not always bring the most innovative thinking to the table. IBM Consulting Services is a dependable option for those looking for experienced professionals to help them achieve their business goals.\n\n\nWe were looking at their solutions in respect to the company's use of SAP products and possible solutions that could be a hybrid model where we uses some IBM and some SAP solutions.",
