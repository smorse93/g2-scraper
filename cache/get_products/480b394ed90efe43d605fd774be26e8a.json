                "review_content": "What do you like best about Box?\nWe migrated over to box 4 years ago and now have over 3k users accessing box daily. The web interface is intuitive and packed with features, but in a way that allows different types of users to either take full advantage or to just use it as a content repository. It's really easy to get users in and working on your content and I particularly appreciate the solid version control and ability to see exactly what's happened/is happening with a given piece of content at any time. Box also integrates with just about anything so in addition to the baked-in features, you can link it with lots of other applications, making the whole experience very seamless. On the admin side, the controls are very straightforward; we found the initial deployment pretty easy and migrating additional data into our instance over the last 4 years has been very simple. With the new data onboarding options, I can see this would be even more straightforward for new customers to move large initial datasets. Our support team at box are helpful and friendly - I enjoy being able to discuss new ideas with them and contributing to the ongoing development of box (where I've already seen several updates related to ideas I've had or supported). Frankly, I can't recommend box enough!\n\nWhat do you dislike about Box?\nThere's isn't anything I specifically dislike about box itself. One challenge we've had is weaning users away from the box drive interface and over to the more powerful web interface. I'm looking forward to some upcoming changes to some of the admin reports which I think are important for anyone with a bigger instance.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBox allows us to collaborate seamlessly on content all around our global business. The search function (combined with tags and/or metadata) make it easy for people to find what they need and get on with their daily work with minimal fuss. The security of knowing our data are backed up in multuple locations means that we won't lose anything and the ability to assign specific sets of content to specific regions makes it easy to comply with differing client requirements (e.g. if a client requires that their data be stored only in the USA, that's possible). One very important feature for us is the solid access controls which enable different parts of our business to be firewalled from one another - a feature that realistically extends right down to invidual users. We deployed at the end of 2019 and it was a life saver during covid - our old systems would certainly not have been able to cope with such a sudden and large-scale shift in working practices. I also like the simplicity of the waterfall permissions system - it means that, with a little organisation, giving people access to the content they need stays simple and doesn't end up in a rabbit warren of user-level permissions like some other cloud storage solutions do.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about Box?\nSharing with others and controlling the access is much better than Sharepoint. When working with a client we can share files with the client so that they can see only that file. But in Sharepoint sometimes we have to share a folder. The new canvas whiteboard feature is good. Box Notes is good, predefined layouts are perfect. For example: Meeting Agenda, project plans, Project Status, etc. The relay feature is good But not explored much. Need training material to use relay effectively\n\nWhat do you dislike about Box?\nExcel in Box can not be edited simultaneously, 2 people can not edit the Excel file stored in the Box. We need a Box for Windows the local machine app to open Excel. Sometimes we faced, when 2 people were working on excel updates could not save. In that scenario, we have to save it to our local drive and then upload it back to Box.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe online file sharing feature is good and we have a better option to control sharing with clients.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about Box?\nI got 50GB of free storage with the phone I purchased. This is truly free. (unlike mega which gives 15 GB free, but the free storage you earn will expire and if your storage exceeds the 15 GB, you lose data or you have to go for a paid plan). It doesn't just disappear after a year or so. There's a limit to the size per file uploaded, but that is fine.\nThere is an automatic backup option for photos, but I wouldn't switch this on.\nThere's a pdf reader if you upload your projects in pdf format.\nThe starter pack will upgrade you to single file upload size of 2GB.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Box?\nSometimes the upload gets stuck and you have to reupload everything again.\nVideos don't stream properly at times.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI think a free cloud storage offering 50GB without any ads itself is a great thing. If you want more you could go for paid packs (which are cheaper than most competitors)",

If you need more storage or features, you'll have to shell out some cash. But hey, I guess it's the price for the convenience. And to be honest, it's not crazy expensive. So, it's more like a minor gripe rather than a deal-breaker.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBox cloud tackles file organization chaos, making my digital life a breeze.

You can easily set permissions for individual users or entire groups, and drag and drop files from your computer. Also, the important categories are conveniently listed on the side, so everything stays in order. Whenever you reopen these documents on your device, any changes you make are instantly saved, so you don't have to worry about others editing them.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Box?\nThe fact that shared URLs can expire unexpectedly worries me because it could lead to dangerous situations if we don't know how long they will be accessible. In addition, once we give ownership to someone else, we cannot get those links back until they relinquish control. Users should always know how to create these URL links and how long they will last.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI use Box to securely store and share documents across my organization. Using it is easy, and I can create folders for specific projects or departments that multiple colleagues can access simultaneously.",

It can have multiple users working within a file as well as a note option. The ability to have all files accessible from any device with an internet connection is a plus.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Box?\nThe downsides are that to collaborate in a file, you must be using the web version of Box. The same goes for using Box notes. Since it is not a program native to Windows, desktop integration can be lacking.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe ability to have high storage space limits per user, infinite collaboration, as well as being able to control sharing settings for individual files within directories is paramount.",

The overall experience is getting better.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Box?\nDesktop sync app requires sync selections to be made using the browser interface, and can be slow to update all users.  Desktop streaming app can be slow to load files, and in-folder preview of files (using the preview pane) only works when the files have been recently used.  Very poor searching when streaming. We had one experience where I stopped the app from loading on a remote computer and it arbitrarily deleted 80% of our files, took 2 days with customer service for them to tell me where to find the files and restore them.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Box:\nBe sure to coordinate use of files in progress to prevent a lot of duplicate files.\n\nWhat problems is Box solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt is convenient to access files from outside the office, and to share files with other team members without emailing to all and without maintaining an in-house server and VPN on remote computers.  Recently I have been able to successfully share files with others outside the organization.",
