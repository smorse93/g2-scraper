                "review_content": "Describe the project or task Altoros helped with:\nAltoros has offered a great breadth of services, including tailored Kubernetes and Istio implementation roadmaps for our development and operations teams to employ. Their predictive analytics, DevOps, and performance monitoring implementation services have also been helpful in getting our teams operating in a more streamlined manner.\n\nWhat do you like best about Altoros?\nAltoros's enterprise cloud services and solutions are very easy to implement and use. The Kubernetes and Istio consulting modules were insightful and comprehensive. Each of Altoros's courses are built and credentialed by certified Kubernetes and cloud implementation resources.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Altoros?\nThe element of the Altoros implementation that I dislike and that can be improved is the movement across Kubernetes adoption maturity levels. Altoros can implement clear levels on the maturity curve for adopting cloud-native and Kubernetes training.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Altoros:\nYou should certainly research the breadth of solutions around CI/CD pipeline implementation, DevOps and Cloud Native approaches prior to deciding on your preferred IT solutions and implementation partner. You should also evaluate the Altoros building blocks and end-to-end solution development approach.\n\nWhat problems is Altoros solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe problems that I am solving with Altoros include a number of disparate solutions that we have implemented that are cloud native and adopt a number of cutting edge solutions today including Kubernetes and Istio. I am also looking to automate a number of my tasks in the cloud in a more streamlined fashion.",
