They also assisted in full implementation of Marketo for our environment.\n\n\nGreat people who know their stuff. They set us up for success from the get-go and have provided consultative advice as we transitioned from HubSpot to Marketo. The implementation was flawless and smooth. They are intelligent, and provided us with great leaders in Rachel and Andrew. Mal and Paul are great to bounce ideas off of. Team is great!\n\n\nThere is nothing in my experience that I disliked about working with LeadMD.\n\n\nI would not recommend implementing Marketo without LeadMD to guide you. Unless you are a Marketo expert, it will be a much more challenging experience. Their services were worth every penny.\n\n\nWe needed someone with specific Marketo experience to help us implement. The biggest benefits is the plethora of best practices they set up in our Marketo environment for us to use. From Tag and Channel Management to creating a Center of Excellence, Smart Lists and more. They were always ten steps ahead and thought of things to add to our instance that we would have never even knew we needed.",

The stuck to the scope of work, over-delivered on what was agreed upon and then went above and beyond when we were having issues. When we needed additional hours to help with campaign migration, they worked with our budget and didn't try to oversell or get us more than we needed. Everything they delivered was well documented and they trained us well to ensure we didn't fail. The team we have was phenomenal and truly were all experts at Marketo- there wasn't a problem that they could not solve.\n\n\nAll the major work was done exactly as requested and delivered on time. I would say communicating project status, getting weekly updates and the like is where there could have been improvement. But overall, that didn't impact the project getting completed on time at all.\n\n\nThey are not the cheapest option, but without a doubt they are the most experienced team of Marketo experts you'll find and will not allow their clients to fail or be unsatisfied.",

Of the partners we reviewed, they came in the highest but we picked them because there is no one better to work with.\n\n\nKeep up to date with your Box account. Much gets added to it and you might get lost. But it's all valuable information and useful all along the way.",

They are a true extension of my marketing team and play an active role in our success as a late stage startup. They also have exceptional project management processes that keep us on track.\n\n\nWe had a few hiccups with project implementation --- primarily do to a lack of process documentation for key stakeholders outside of marketing. The LeadMD team acknowledged this and developed documentation as soon as this was identified as a critical need.",
