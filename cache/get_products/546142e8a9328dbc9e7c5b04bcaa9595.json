The ease of use of the website is a great help and the ability to get the output in a variety of formats has come in handy more than once.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nThere have been a few missed deadlines and if a language other than English is requested for a dual language video, the English is disregarded.  At least the English captioners made an attempt to caption the Spanish.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nWhile I am not on the Accounts Payable side of things, 3Play seems to work well with our school on that end.  We have used them for many years and will continue to do so.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nQuick turnaround of video captions, especially after the pandemic hit. All of our classes went online and there were a large number of students that needed captioning.",

Of course the video that he located was not captioned.  3Play was able to caption it and with short turn around it was in the student's email well before his presentation.\n\nWhat do you like best about 3Play Media?\nCustomer Service at 3Play is responsive, efficient, and helpful.  They will guide you through the process and are ready to jump in if something becomes confusing.  I appreciate the fact that the customer has many different options for uploading videos.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nSome of the menus could be more intuitive.  Like all software and services, there are periodic changes to the website which can be confusing at first.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nI would recommend visiting the site and learning about the process of submitting videos before you actually need the video.  This will save time and you'll be able to upload the videos and make the request earlier.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWith 3Play we can very quickly caption videos for our students.  This company is great for providing last-minute requests of captioned videos.  Their free webinars on ADA related issues are also informative and helpful.",

Typically, I can have my work captioned in a week or less, and I appreciate that they provide an expedited option for those times when we're working against tight deadlines.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nI find it inconvenient when videos are archived after a certain period. For instance, we previously added closed captions in English to a series of videos. A few years later, when we had the resources to add Spanish subtitles to the same videos, the process of unarchiving and making these changes proved to be challenging. I had to engage 3play customer support to assist in this task.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nAccessibility is a universal best practice, and 3Play simplifies the process.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\n3play provides a user-friendly platform for accessibility for our educational videos, catering to individuals with disabilities, their families, and the professionals involved in their lives.",

Review all of the services being offered and their quality, especially for audio descriptions or new requirements that are on the horizon.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\n3Play Media creates captioning for our videos which helps our team maintain accessibility standards and allows us to be more productive. We use them about 5-20 times per month depending on our current project needs. It's very easy to submit an order then download the caption, as well as edit the caption when needed.\n\nIt's also nice that there is an option to have a temporary link for partners who don't have a 3Play account to directly edit captions which makes for an efficient workflow as we don't have to middle manage. There are a lot of features in the style of captioning, the final format output, and service tiers.",

This wasn't a problem for us.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nTalk to them in advance to figure out what your needs are.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nMy company was working on a very big project with around 150 video clips that needed audio descriptions and closed captions related to an important test for our stakeholders. The AD had to read a very specific way, as test scores can be impacted by how these video clips are interpreted. 3Play did a great job providing the AD and then, when we had issues, they fixed the problems very quickly, even setting up a conference call with very short notice to help us help ourselves. When we needed to upgrade from Standard to Extended on quite a few videos, they did this for us with a very quick turnaround.",

The platform for uploading and ordering transcription is easy to use; files are easy to categorize and retrieve; and it's very easy to tweak or make edits to captions, as the platform will flag any words or phrases it's not sure of. We are a highly technical program (clinical research/healthcare) and the captioners are excellent at interpreting acronyms and medical terminology.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nWe've had some issues with invoicing and payment that I think could have been more easily resolved by a more attentive service rep. In fairness though, I work for a large university and their process for working with vendors is probably pretty cumbersom.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nThe 3Play Media captioners are typically speedy. Often they get products back to you before the stated turnaround time. I always give myself enough lead time to choose the discounted \"slower\" delivery date (instead of the \"standard time\"), but usually they deliver pretty quickly anyway.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI run an online graduate program, and accessibility best practices and ADA standards require that we provide transcripts/captions for classes. The transcripts are also particularly useful for learners whose first language is not English, as well as neurodiverse learners.",

I love their cusomer portal, and its organizational capabilities.  Customer service is always courteous and works with me to find solutions to unusual situations.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nNot really a dislike, but this still holds true:  In order to create captions that require two languages, we had to order English and Polish, then combine the SRT files manually by ourselves. It would be nice if there was a process for this, as we had to be charged twice for the length of each video- one in English, the other in Polish. The instructor spoke both languages. We may have to do more foreign language courses in the future.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nYou get what you pay for, and even if you feel 3Play's prices are higher, that's exactly why!

If this is done without human intervention, I am scared of AI.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nThe caption placement, with human input, seems very stilted and even minimally comprehensible at times. I find myself spending hour upon hour making revisions.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nI would recommend 3Play wholeheartedly, but I would warn them not to think that, because it is pricey, it does the whole job. There is still a need to go through the subtitles to fill in any gaps (or \"INAUDIBLE\" words), to correct for mistakes in speach recognition, and most of all to ensure that the subtitle placements make sense and provide the readers a comfortable, easy-to-follow facsimile of the presentation. It's not that I would expect BBC quality, but the last word of a sentence dangling on to a new caption, sentences broken without any regard for sense, such things make you doubt that the placement service is worth what it costs.  Which is not to say it's not a big help.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nPreparing online presentations for consumption by the general public is more time-consuming than anyone realizes. 3Play is our major partner in this arduous process.",

When our group tried out other services and finally found 3Play, it was a no-brainer.

If there is one thing I would like to see, it would be more features when it comes to the layout and design of their player. Functionally, it works great. However, since it is embedded using an iframe, it can be a little tricky to keep it mobile-friendly.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nBy all means, check out the other providers out there. That way, you can be confident in choosing 3Play.  They're doing it right.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nTranscripts, Captioning, and Audio Descriptions for accessible videos. We hold online workshops and record most of them. As a State/County organization, our materials need to be accessible for those with impairments. Before 3Play we weren't able to post many of our video resources. We had to rely on other means to come up with the captioning, which wasn't very accurate and took a lot of extra work and manpower to make corrections and finalize. With 3Play, we are now able to post just about every workshop we record with ease!",

I also like that after an event that 3Play has captioned, you can ask them to make the captions 100% accurate for a very small fee.  It saves my staff time and is done quickly.  I also like that you can add common words prior to the live sessions to increase accuracy.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nWhile 3Play works directly with Zoom for webinars, if you do not use the email 3Play sends to start captioning, it can be a little tricky.  It is still possible but takes a few more steps.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nWhile the live captioning costs a bit more than the regular captioning, the higher accuracy (especially if you put common words in first) is well worth it!\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOur biggest need is captioning and transcription.  3Play offers live captioning for our live web meetings which offers a higher accuracy rate and the cost is affordable. We also use 3Play to caption and transcribe other videos we use.",

Plus, it is easy to make corrections if necessary.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nSometimes transcripts could be more accurately done. 3Play Media tends to do well with sources that are clear, but struggles to keep up with common vernacular like \"ums\" and \"uhs.\"\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nIf you're in a pinch, go for it. 3Play offers the fastest turnaround time I have seen for captioning service (yes, even for long-form media), and makes it easy to correct any mistakes! I have not been disappointed by using this service.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe biggest problem 3Play Media has helped me solve is time. While I have had to make small corrections to 3Play Media transcripts, they are worth the quick turnaround time for all of my captioning needs.",

This doesn't necessarily need to be 'final' quality, so a draft price for early transcripts would be beneficial.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 3Play Media:\nMake sure that you are giving yourself plenty of time to produce subtitles/transcripts for your videos. This will mean that you can have them produced at a much cheaper (non-expediated) rate.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIn order for our online video content to be accessibility compliant, subtitles and transcripts must be provided.

                "review_content": "What do you like best about 3Play Media?\nOne of the notable aspects of 3Play Media is its commitment to delivering accurate captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions. Their technology and processes strive to ensure high-quality results, which can be crucial for accessibility compliance and providing an inclusive experience for all users.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 3Play Media?\nhe software's interface appeared cluttered and unintuitive, making it challenging for users to navigate and locate essential features. The placement of certain buttons and menus seemed arbitrary and did not align with common design patterns that users are accustomed to. This resulted in a steep learning curve for new users and an inefficient workflow for experienced ones.\n\nWhat problems is 3Play Media solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAccessibility Compliance: One of the primary problems that 3Play Media addresses is ensuring accessibility compliance for digital media content. Laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), require that organizations make their online content accessible to individuals with disabilities. 3Play Media's services, such as captioning, transcription, and audio description, help organizations meet these compliance requirements, ensuring equal access to their content for individuals with hearing or visual impairments.\n\nInclusivity: By providing accurate captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions, 3Play Media promotes inclusivity in multimedia content. This benefits individuals with disabilities by enabling them to consume and engage with video and audio content effectively. Inclusivity is not only important for compliance but also for creating an inclusive user experience that caters to a diverse audience.\n\nImproved User Experience: Adding captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions to multimedia content enhances the user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities. Captions, for example, can be valuable in noisy environments, for non-native speakers, or in situations where audio cannot be played. Transcripts provide a searchable and navigable text version of the content, allowing users to quickly find specific information. Audio descriptions enable individuals with visual impairments to understand the visual elements of video content. These enhancements contribute to a more engaging and user-friendly experience for a broader audience.\n\nTime and Resource Efficiency: For organizations and content creators, manually transcribing and captioning multimedia content can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. 3Play Media's services automate these processes, saving time and effort for users. By outsourcing these tasks to 3Play Media, organizations can focus on their core activities while ensuring that their content is accessible and compliant.\n\nIntegration and Workflow Streamlining: 3Play Media offers integrations with popular video platforms, learning management systems, content management systems, and video players. This integration capability streamlines the workflow for users, allowing them to easily incorporate captioning and transcription services into their existing systems and processes. This reduces the friction of managing and implementing accessibility features and simplifies the overall content creation and distribution workflow.",
