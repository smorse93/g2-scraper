This is where Andovar come in. We can (and do) work with them on a per project basis and can choose between their AI service of human. With the former, the AI content generated is still reviewed and cross-checked by professional translators (etc) which is a service that we cannot fully replicate in house.\n\nCustomer support is prompt and very responsive and, so far, Andovar has delivered within each predetermined deadline which, as a media company, is essential for us.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Andovar?\nNo significant dislikes encountered yet. Providing all requirements are clearly itemized pre kick-off, that is what you are going to receive.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Andovar:\nI would definitely recommend using Andovar's localization and global translation services for quality online content production.\n\nWhat problems is Andovar solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe work with Andovar to rapidly turn around online video content, seeking their assistance with transcriptions, translations and the production of closed captions (subtitles) generated and provided to us in .srt format.",

They are incredibly responsive, always willing to help and have become an extension of our team rather than just a vendor. Our experience working with Andovar has been truly exceptional, and we owe much of our success to their dedicated team.

However, this is a minor issue and has not impacted the high-quality translations Andovar delivers. In fact, despite the minor issues with the system, Andovar's team has consistently delivered excellent translations in a timely and professional manner.

Here are my recommendations:\n\n1) Streamline communications by integrating with Slack or a similar messaging platform to communicate with Andovar. This will help to streamline communication and reduce response times.\n2) Streamline file sharing by using a shared cloud-based drive. This will help to ensure that files are easily accessible and can be shared quickly.\n3) Develop quality glossaries that are specific to your industry, also known as a termbase, as this will help to ensure correct translations of industry-specific terms and jargon.\n4) Ensure that your English content is of high quality to avoid quality issues in the translations. It's important to remember that the quality of the source content will impact the quality of the translated outputs delivered.\n5) Understand the Andovar process so that you can focus on key areas that will facilitate their work. By understanding their process, you can help to ensure that the project runs smoothly and efficiently.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend working with Andovar for their exceptional localization services and outstanding customer support. By following these recommendations, you can help to ensure a seamless and successful partnership with Andovar.\"\n\nWhat problems is Andovar solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAndovar is solving the challenge of localizing our content into multiple languages, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.
