We have been using git in our organization for a very long time. in our day-to-day life, we back up code so it makes our code integration with software smooth. also, git documentation and customer support are good so it's good to find answers and get support from the world. about frequency, as I mentioned above we use it every day.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\ngit provides good support but there is no main back in git. also when you accidentally fire any command it has the power to delete entire code from Cloude. need more power full extension for tools like android studio, vs code.\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nto backup all over code and make separate lines for development, release, and final code. Also, git provides easy code changes and team working that make it more powerful and that's why our organisation",

Also, free web hosting for projects for students is incredible. I am using the Github Developer pack in which I love the Github pages feature alot.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\nActually I love all the features of github. I use Github on daily basis for uploading my projects. However one thing, I dont' like much is proper guidance of usage. As there are so many features in github (which is obviously good), but I am not able to know the uses of all the buttons. So I have to google and then I get to know the use of feature.\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nGithub is providing a complete environment from managing the code, hosting it and after uploading that, we can also control it's versions.

Then, they can easily make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see. It allows integration with other vendors and provide full customer support. That attract me to use it every day and it is easy to implement by ourselves.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\nThere are a few things  hate about GitHub are\nIt doesn't allow for the creation of private repositories.\nSome useful features of GitHub are paid and that's the reason most people stopped using it.\nGitHub doesn't offer a good API development.\nThere are not many features in GitHub like other repository platforms in the market.\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nDevelopers like us use GitHub to work together on a single project with the benefit of version control.

For example, for smaller projects, I simply use GitHub issues to keep track of backlogs and sprints, but for bigger projects, I can use the Projects module and GitHub actions. I also love the security alerts, saved me a few times from possible credentials leaks.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\nThere isn't anything particular I dislike about GitHub,\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nVersion controlling is the primary problem and we were using Bitbucket before which is part of Atlassian tools (since we use Jira). Bitbucket worked fine for version controlling but the user-friendly that GitHub provides was unmatched. Interns that we hire know how to work around GitHub more than compared to Bitbucket so its majority saving a lot of time too.",

Then the system would give me a file of the differences.  This allowed me to just make the changes without having to figure out what the changes were.  After I updated the database, I merged the file into the Main to be ready for the next file with new transactions.  I was able to keep a copy of the field, so I could recover at any point if needed.  I am part of a Software Development team and all the Developers use GitHub here to manage/track/document any system code changes for several systems.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\nSometimes I accidentally made a multiple in my Update file area and I had trouble getting it back to one update file.  I was a novice with GitHub and my boss gave me the highlights to perform one type of task weekly on one file that grew.  So, it was hard to learn how to recover from a mistake without my boss's assistance.  Eventually, I will add junior developer skills to assist our developers as I learn Apex and Oracle on my own.  I am an Applications System Analyst and GitHub is a minor part of my workload at this point.  I think the documentation help is geared more toward experienced users, and not novices who never used it and then got a little mentoring and used it minimally.  I am not sure if you have a section on Getting Started on very basic use to gain experience and help towards more advanced use.  THat would be my only suggestion, as this tool is usually geared toward major Developers, not someone branching into the area with little experience.\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt is a major time saver as it creates a file for me that I do not have to manually make, that allows me to complete a task in 1-2 hours instead of many hours or a few days.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about GitHub?\nGitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration in software development. Here are some of the things I like best about this tool:\n\nA powerful version control system:  GitHub offers a robust version control system, primarily based on Git. The seamless integration allows developers to track changes to their code, work on different branches, and easily merge changes from multiple contributors.\nEase of use: The platform is easy to use and supports private and public repositories. In addition, GitHub offers a free plan for individual users and small-scale projects.\nCollaborative workflow: The code collaboration provides a user-friendly interface for effective collaboration, including pull requests and code reviews, enabling seamless teamwork and knowledge sharing.\nProject management tools: GitHub has an excellent system that helps manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests. The tool allows for efficient project management and timely issue resolution.\nThriving community: GitHub fosters a vibrant developer community, creating an ecosystem that encourages open-source contributions and collaboration. Here, you can find engaging projects, follow repositories, and contribute to the larger developer community.\nContinuous integration and deployment: GitHub's integration with various CI/CD tools automates build, testing, and deployment processes. It ensures project stability and streamlines the development workflow.\nExtensibility: GitHub offers extensive APIs and integrations to allow developers to customize the platform to their needs. These extend its functionality and integrate with other tools, enhancing flexibility and customization options.\nSecurity and access control: GitHub provides outstanding security features. These include two-factor authentication and access control mechanisms. They ensure maximum security for repositories and protect sensitive code.\nPersonal Projects and Portfolios: GitHub offers a free plan, ideal for developers working on personal projects or building portfolios. It provides a reliable and feature-rich platform to showcase and share their code with others. The visibility is valuable for job applications or freelance opportunities, as it allows potential employers or clients to assess a developer's skills and coding capabilities.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\nOne limitation of GitHub is that some features, such as private repositories, are available only in paid plans. Freelancers or small teams working on personal projects but unable to commit to a subscription plan often struggle with this.\n\nWhile GitHub excels in many aspects, one area that could benefit from improvement is its learning curve for beginners. Navigating the platform and understanding more advanced features might be slightly challenging for new users. However, GitHub provides comprehensive documentation and an active community that can assist in overcoming this initial hurdle.\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nGitHub solves the critical problem of efficient code management and collaboration. It eliminates the chaos of manually handling code versions, ensuring developers have a single source of truth for their projects. The seamless collaboration features enable effective teamwork, reducing miscommunications and accelerating development. Furthermore, GitHub's version control capabilities give me the confidence to experiment and iterate without fearing irreparable damage to my codebase.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about GitHub?\nI like GitHub's robust platform for collaboration and version control the most as a student. It makes group assignments and open-source contributions much simpler for me because it enables me to collaborate on coding projects with my classmates without any issues. The entire development process is made simpler by the ability to build repositories, manage branches, and merge changes, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and conflicts are quickly addressed.\n\nEven beginners like me may use GitHub because to its simple UI and clear functions. I like how it offers a central location for project management, issue tracking, and code sharing. I can quickly browse through other projects, investigate various programming languages, and gain knowledge from the efforts of the community.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GitHub?\nThe learning curve for utilising Git, the version control system that powers GitHub, is one element. Understanding terms like branches, commits, and pull requests can at first seem intimidating to a newcomer. Although there are tutorials and documentation available, using Git's features to their maximum functionality still requires effort and practise.\n\nManaging merge conflicts on GitHub is another difficulty I experience. Conflicts can arise when many contributors make modifications to the same code files when working cooperatively. It can take a lot of effort and require a thorough understanding of the coding to resolve these issues. Even though GitHub has tools to aid in conflict resolution, the process can still be difficult and complicated, especially for new users like me.\n\nWhat problems is GitHub solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt offers a centralised version control platform. Before GitHub, it might be difficult and error-prone to collaborate with peers while managing several versions of code files. I can easily keep track of changes, make branches, and merge alterations thanks to GitHub's version control system, which is based on Git. This makes sure that my work is well-organized and that I can quickly go back to earlier versions if necessary. My productivity is increased, and I feel more secure because there is no longer a chance that I may lose code or accidentally overwrite someone else's work.\nGitHub makes easy collaboration possible. As a student, I frequently work on group assignments, and it can be difficult to coordinate efforts with my classmates. By offering a shared repository where we can instantly collaborate, GitHub addresses this issue.  This collaborative workflow fosters effective teamwork and promotes a deeper understanding of code through code reviews and discussions.",
