Also, I noted that thanks to 99 designs, I can work continuously and compensate for the unsuccessful tenders with a high price for the project.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 99Designs?\nI am not very happy with the level of perception of the design itself by clients, you often understand that in order to please the client you need to do not a high-quality design, but something that the client likes.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\nI definitely recommend this site, specially to designers beginners.\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThis site has helped me develop my design skill and expand my portfolio.

Overall NetReputation as a company admired the work 99Design does.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\nIf you are seeking a design to make a quick yet high-quality engaging creative we highly recommend that you check 99Designs out. Zero commitment you can hire as you please.\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs a startup company, we sometimes have a limited marketing budget.

It suggests to be a chat but new responses don't show up, you have to reload the page manually. Notifications are partly for comments in conversations and partly for comments on individual drafts which makes handling error prone. 99Designs should make the messenger a real live-chat feature. E.g. in an overlay box next to the designs, but always just one conversation per designer, not per design draft please.\n\n99Designs should let go with those strict rules that make clients feel like in a prison. People like me want to communicate freely. It's my own risk to have conversations outside 99Designs anyway, so why do they threaten me if I want to? Proxying/censoring all conversations is not the way to go to earn trust from clients.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\nMake sure your specifications are complete and well thought through. That saves time and avoids conflicts with the 99Designs staff later. Alterations of the specifications are not welcome and designers get their drafts deleted if they exceed the scope of the specified project (even if designer AND customer welcome them).\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\nTime savings when finding and hiring designers.\nBigger variety of ideas and drafts than when working with just one designer or agency.",

I myself have bought great creative work for our campaigns and have made tremendous success working with impeccable talents all over the globe. They have escrow system that will ensure you get the best possible deal without being run-over. You can opt for a blind contest to make sure the entries are unique and it follows your strict brief. You can be very specific with your brief and still get great results. I used 99Designs everytime we have huge projects and market launches. I have several freelancers of my picks ready to be hired, and they are all thanks to 99Designs.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 99Designs?\nThe betting process takes some time, but of course everything that is worth it really does take some time. But when you have a tight schedule, better improve their betted freelancers if people are wary of running their own contests. That's just one thing I noticed, but aside from that, nothing much that will hinder a good result from them.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\nYes, 99deisgns have grown from its humble beginning to one of the largest freelance marketplaces in creative space. Highly recommended especially when you are in doubt about outsourcing your work.\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\nA lot, if I mentioned all, it would take a whole day. It saved our department a load of money hiring an in-house talent that usually is not a good fit for how we wanted it to be. Since we are a department of resul-basis, we like to keep things simple. So we decided to outsource the creative work, and we found 99Designs has a huge marketplace of talents and creatives we can choose from. We can be very specific with our brief and still get it on our target schedule.",

I liked the way you could speak to your designers in order for them to change what you did and didn't like, so they could improve and upload a better logo. I liked the timing for both the \"manager\" and the \"designer\", giving us a time frame to do things and when to do the things we need to.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 99Designs?\nThe fact that the people creating a logo are just recycling something they have used in the past without looking at the title of your project. The fact that the \"designers\" grab existing well-known logos and use them as their own. example: I had a person try to sell me their idea with the adobe creative suite logo edited. I disliked that the designers had no experience and were not interested in helping my brand but were more interested in the money on the plate.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\nI would do a little bit more research before getting into this site or get real designers that are committed to making your brand stand out from other brands. These designers are just in for the money and not much for the design of the brand you are seeking or for your company's culture.\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAn adjacent company needed a new brand look to better portray their business to their clients. We needed something that could differentiate this company from us.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about 99Designs?\n99 design is a platform where contests sell and buy design services.\nThe basic operation is that the person who needs a logo, a book cover, a product label, a web design ... is registered on the web, fill in your brief where you give the information of what you are looking for, decide how much you want to pay and Create a contest for 7 days.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 99Designs?\nThe first thing I have to say is that I do not like the theme of design contests.\nIt seems to me that in any profession in which competitions are held, the professional is degraded and their work is not valued with dignity.\n\nAn example: recently my sister calls me and tells me that there is a brand that she likes very much that she has opened a contest for designers to send their proposals for the bags of the new season (we are going to have a full-fledged packaging job). The prize: a EUR 150 voucher to spend on your products.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\n\n1o They will receive many more designs, it is a great variety of styles, that if they hire a professional so they do not have to think about the general concept, they save the art director.\n\n2nd That type of work costs more than EUR 150\n\n3o You have to spend your prize if or if in your products, the money returns to your hands!\n\nIt's a win-win, but for the clear company ...\n\nAs I said and I think you can understand, I'm not a fan of this type of contest, but in turn, as I do not like to judge or criticize something without knowing it first hand, I decided to register in 99 design and today I tell you my experience\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\n\n\nThere are different price packages, which means that the more you pay, obviously better designs will be received and there is even a plus package in which only selected designers with a great track record on the platform participate.\n\nDuring the contest week, the designers who sign up for their contest send proposals and receive feedback from the client so they can make improvements in their designs and be the winners.\n\nOnce the stage of proposals has passed, the client has the option to close the contest and decide if he does not like any can leave the contest deserted or choose the designs that pass to a final of 3 days where the designers make changes regarding the feedback they receive and in the end there is a winner.",

It was nice to have a non-objective party output what I wanted the brand to emulate.\n\nWhat do you dislike about 99Designs?\nBeing approached by so many developers after the contest. It was somewhat helpful at first, but now I just feel like my name and company are on a spam list we can't get off of.\n\nRecommendations to others considering 99Designs:\nBe ready to make decisions quickly - know what you want to receive from the service and be committed to the process.\n\nWhat problems is 99Designs solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWebsite design by creative, talented people that are looking to visually design what you verbally request.",
