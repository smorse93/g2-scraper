One of the special key strengths of sublime text is exceptional performance, its fast and responsive even with big files and extensive projects.In Addition, Sublime Text editor has wide variety of programming languages.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nFor me,  i dislike Sublime Text interms of its license because Sublime Text is No Free Software although sublime text is free to download and use, it encourage the user to purchase a license for continuation of using the sublime text. In Addition, Sublime is Less user-friendly for beginners.\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nFor me , the problem i encountered in sublime text is the step to reproduce the issues. and also the licensing issue and the limited IDE Features. but I've solve the problem when I purchase the license and to check the Package control settings of IDe to resolve the bugs and issue.And also i will switch to a default theme in IDE to see if the issue persists.",

Numerous programming languages, including Python, Javascript, and C++, are supported. This is one of the greatest code editors available because of its many features, which include Find and Replace, Indentation, Syntax, Plug-in integration, and Build Systems. You stay focused on your job thanks to the straightforward subtle design and clean UI-UX interface.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nThis Software's ability to automatically recognise the code type would be useful. After a while, the Free Version starts to bother you with pop-up notifications using you to purchase the Paid version. Furthermore, compared to other options, it is slightly more expensive, and the cross-platform support may use some work.\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIts functions as a text editor and code editor are helpful in day-to-day tasks. I've been more productive and efficient because to the support for so many coding languages, plug-ins, and auto-completion capabilities. I can troubleshoot any problems more quickly since the syntax highlighting aids in the maintenance aids in the maintenance of neat, consistent and sstructured code.",

Because VS code is proper IDE with a lot of plugins, you could do a lot of simple things with Sublime. But Building projects primarily with Sublime as your text editor is gonna be super tough.\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nSo whenever I write a meeting notes or some kind a notes and then I want to send that attachment over slack or email. I find it very handy as I save the file in sublime every now and then and drop the attachment on that.",

Its quite easy to implement configurations once you get the hang of it\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nThere is a steep learning curve for beginners as Most peoples are used to IDEs which provide lots of in-depth suggestions and auto completions. most of people would need help of forums or documentation or support to get examples of build configurations which isnt ideal\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nA need of quick easy to use lightweight text editor without too much complicated setup",

It is available for a variety of operating systems such as MacOS, Windows, Linux, and more. The installation process is super easy. The majority of users find it useful even with the non-license version although you can purchase the subscription which is not much costly.\nSublime can be configured in many ways you can configure it for programming languages like CPP, Python, and more. It has a plethora of extension support that enables a lot of great functionality to ease our day-to-day tasks. I have added many code snippets which saves me lots of hours of coding as I don't have to re-implement them.\nSublime is a super easy and handy-to-use text editor. I recommend everyone to try it once.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nSublime doesn't come with any in-build extensions pre-installed. It would be great if it provide users the ability to select a few mostly used extensions during the installation process. If I need to configure sublime to any programming language then its really difficult and every time it consumes a lot of time and effort. Documentation for such a configuration process would be a great addition.\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI use Sublime Text not only as a text editor but also code editor as well. Firstly I use it to take important notes from my team meeting and share them with my colleague. I also configured the CPP and Python programming environment hence I'm able to code and execute it directly within the Sublime. Since it is super lightweight, I don't even have to worry about resource consumption and I can keep Sublime Text open throughout my session. I highly recommend it to everyone, just try it once.",

It has support for various programming languages like C++, Javascript, Python. Various Features like Find and Replace, Indentation, Syntax, Plug-in integration and Build Systems are what make this one of the best Code Editors Out There. The Clean UI-UX Interface and the Simple Subtle Design keeps you focused on the work.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nIt would be helpful if the Software can Auto-Recognize Code Type. The Free Version keeps notifying with pop-ups to buy the Paid version which become annoying after a time. Also It is a little bit expensive than others and the Cross Platform Support needs to be improved.\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt helps in daily Tasks from acting as a Text Editor to a Code Editor. The Support for so many Coding Languages, along with the Plug-ins and the Auto-completion features has helped improve my efficiency and productivity. The Syntax Highlighting also helps me in maintaining a clean code with Structure and Consistency so it helps me in debugging any issues easily.",

It offers advanced search and replace functionality with support for regular expressions, allowing me to quickly find and modify code across multiple files.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nOnly thing which can be improved is Unlike some other text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), Sublime Text does not have a built-in package manager. While there are third-party package managers available, the absence of an official package manager can make it slightly less convenient to discover and install plugins\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nSublime Text provides a robust and feature-rich environment for editing code. Its syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code navigation features make it easier to read, write, and understand code, improving the overall coding experience. This leads to reduce coding and debugging time and hence reducing release adtes.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about Sublime Text?\nI love that Sublime Text is lightweight and fast. It's remarkably fast and efficient, allowing you to work on your coding without experiencing any lag, even when heavy resource-consuming applications run in the background. It's cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, which is a considerable benefit as it allows you to seamlessly work across different OS, including the widely favored one among programmers in Linux. The extensivity in customization offered by Sublime Text is excellent. You can change the theme, color schemes, and keyboard hotkeys. You can cater the editor to your preference and boost productivity by having essential tools on easy-to-access hotkeys. Like other IDEs, Sublime Text offers many features to help your coding, like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, search and replace function, and multiple tab support. Features that Sublime Text lacks can easily be implemented with plugins and packages found on the website. You can improve functionality, add support for programming languages that aren't built-in, and more.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sublime Text?\nSublime Text is closed-source, so you cannot modify the IDE to meet specific needs. It also heavily lacks built-in collaboration features, making it less viable for real-time collaborative editing.\n\nWhat problems is Sublime Text solving and how is that benefiting you?\nSublime Text is what I use for code editing during work. It provides a perfect environment for writing and editing code, providing features like code folding, multi-cursor editing, split editing, etc. These features make it ideal for software development projects. We can seamlessly organize our projects within Sublime Text by creating project-specific settings and quickly navigating between files and folders. It also has support for integrating external build systems, so we can compile and run code within the editor without using another compiler just for compilation. One significant benefit of Sublime Text is that with the help of plugins like Package Control, we can automate many tasks for convenience. These tasks include package management, linting, running tests, and improving our workflow efficiency. Sublime Text also has broad language support, making it viable for writing and editing in any language. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub, allowing us to quickly make push requests and merges. Our productivity has significantly increased after we collectively started using Sublime Text over other IDEs for daily coding and quick editing.",
