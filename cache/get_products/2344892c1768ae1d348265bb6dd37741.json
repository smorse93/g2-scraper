Mittcute is a social activities app where users connect through activity interest.\n\nWhat do you like best about Appster?\nAppster showcases an excellent communication structure with a friendly and professional approach to problem solving and management. Appster's agile methodology makes it easy to coordinate budget allocation and fundraising, while their concern for customer satisfaction is evident in helping to develop a cost effective MVP, constantly asking how they can improve your experience, and always being a click away.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Appster?\nI haven't found anything I dislike about Appster. The tricky thing can be the time differences at times, yet it can come to an advantage as well. It's all a matter of organization and perspective, their transparency and clear work structure comes in handy to make the use of time differences a plus.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Appster:\nKnow what you want and don't be afraid to ask any questions. Besides having a friendly and knowledgeable staff, they are transparent and passionate about their work and they want you to feel passionate and knowledgeable about your project too.",
