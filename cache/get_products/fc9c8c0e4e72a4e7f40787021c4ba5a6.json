We needed 3rd party expertise to advise us on available options, and validate our own suggestions. Every time we engage with Sirius, they guide us successfully from start to finish. And more importantly, when things happen unexpectedly, they Sirius always is available to quickly get things back on track. For us, a vendor that not only delivers what is requested, but goes above and beyond to provide additional context is important to the overall success and continuous education of the team.\n\n\nSirius is a company with lots of talent. Our main business contact is always willing to help and manages each time to bring the right talent around the table to make us successful as their client. In short, their expertise and skill set, combined with broad industry knowledge, makes them a valuable partner around the table.\n\n\nThere is nothing we dislike. We typically dislike being spammed till death by marketing and sales material, but Sirius is not doing this. Hence we experience the relationship as a mutually beneficial one\n\n\nSirius is a great one-stop shop for all IT needs. Initially a smaller scope vendor for us, their expertise and knowledge, coupled with broad market experience has increased their value and support as business partner significantly. Highly recommended vendor to build a relationship with.\n\n\nWe are solving technically complex projects with products, knowledge and services from Sirius. We have increased our system reliability, simplified ongoing system management and improved operational efficiency with Sirius as partner. Lastly, our investments are driving the value we expected that we had set as a goal for each project.",

VMware licensing, EMC  storage, etc..?\n\n\nThe people -- I love our account manager, Lindsey Hamer and her technical counterpart Joel Cason.  Both are very good at their jobs and very attentive when needed.\n\n\nQuote turn-arounds could be faster.  I'm not sure if the delay comes from the Sirius side or the vendor side, but a lot of times quotes seem to take a lot longer than I would expect.\n\n\nI have found Sirius to be one of the better VARs in the area.  I wouldn't hesitate to consider them if you are looking.  They make sure you're getting the solution you need and not just the thing you thought you wanted.  I rely on them to make sure I'm not making stupid decisions and I rely on them to \"have my back\".\n\n\nSirius helps me with server and storage design and delivery.",
