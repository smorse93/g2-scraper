Very poor after sales service and billing, invoicing and license renewal processes are confusing and overly complicated.\n\n\nEvaluate alternatives before settling on SHI as a VAR for any of your solutions. They are not efficient and retain little knowledge about your past purchases to simplify the renewal process, billing/invoicing, etc.",
