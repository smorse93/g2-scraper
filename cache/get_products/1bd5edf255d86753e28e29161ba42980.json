Sajan is great for allowing us as a company to be able to communicate easily and efficiently.\n\nWhat do you like best about Acolad?\nI love being able to use Sagan, or AMPLEXOR, to be able to explain our products and services to potential clients all around the world. I love the website translation ability. This way, the language barrier is so longer an issue.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Acolad?\nWhen first using the service, it is rather difficult sometimes to find the exact service that you want. Luckily I had a coworker teach me how to use it.\n\nWhat problems is Acolad solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs I explained earlier, Sajan has allowed us to overcome the language barrier that often exists with international companies.Having the ability to easily translate a website page or offer to potential clients, coworkers, and colleagues is a game-changer and greatly improves efficiency.",

Actually, this Company is not static one, it has evolved throughout years, and we now can say that today it's a Leader Company in Translation, undertaking translations in many field, basically those that contribute to Marketing Management globally.\n\nWhat do you like best about Acolad?\nI always enjoy working in a Digital Environment, that gives me possibility to work in the fileds I mostly have experience, as well as language pairs, in a collaborative way, where work is shared among translators, besides feeling that I work in a dynamic digital environment, with the chance to be creative and contribute to  progress and evolution of Business, and here is the result of pleasure for translator and satisfaction that you feel useful you feel that you offer, by developping your creativity.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Acolad?\nThere's actually nothing to dislike here in Sajan!! Actually methods of work share is well organized and well structured that everyone does what actually one can do in the field of translation, with professionalism. Thus translator feels always safe in work, while one sees creativity an dability to offer skyrocket at times.
