After getting in contact with them on a Tuesday, they had arranged four interviews for me within 24 hours. All the companies I interviewed with aligned with what I wanted in a company.\n\nAmaraj was available throughout the process, including switching my visa (which was a highly complex process). Whether it was early morning or late night, Amaraj was there to put me at ease and lead me on the path to success.\n\nIf your're looking for a role in PR, you will 100% find your ideal role with the help of Aquent.\n\nWhat do you like best about Aquent?\nHow friendly Amaraj was - everytime I spoke to her, it was like speaking to a close friend.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Aquent?\nThe team is lovely! They make the whole process easy.\n\nWhat problems is Aquent solving and how is that benefiting you?\nN/A",
