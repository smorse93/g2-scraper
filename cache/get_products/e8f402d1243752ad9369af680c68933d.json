I work in the IT industry and have done some stockroom work where I performed an inventory on hardware assets. It is challenging and can be a pain to do.\n\nWhat do you dislike about AmberLeaf?\nThe ROI. I have noticed this is a relatively cheap stock. It's going to take some time for this company to grow in value especially in a volatile market right now when there is a possible recession.\n\nWhat problems is AmberLeaf solving and how is that benefiting you?\nPeople are more distracted and unfocused now. With this AI solution, you can get data to customers faster and save time from having to train customers hands-on. Customers may even be more focused and committed to learning and even get ahead in their careers.",
