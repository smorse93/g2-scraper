                "review_content": "Describe the project or task aheadWorks helped with:\nMy experience with AheadWorks started with Store Credit and Refund for Magento 2. I liked the idea of keeping money within a store while refunding. Not to allow customers to return products means losing their trust, but to allow means losing store revenue. So, the Support Team suggested to me this extension of converting refunds into credits. So money is kept in store and customers are provided with credits they can spend on other purchases.\n\nWhat do you like best about aheadWorks?\nObviously it's easy-to-use functionality and an opportunity for automated refunds.\n\nWhat do you dislike about aheadWorks?\nI had some problems with installation but Support helped me with it.\n\nRecommendations to others considering aheadWorks:\nCredit system has increased our revenue and retained customers within the store. I continue working with other AheadWorks extensions because it's a provider I trust.\n\nWhat problems is aheadWorks solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI strongly recommend AheadWorks, because they really care about their clients and create necessary extensions for business.",

                "review_content": "Describe the project or task aheadWorks helped with:\nWe use the Blog for Magento 2 module for creating and sharing blogs about our business industry and products. Since our offering includes multiple categories and subcategories, the feature of Categories, Tags, and Related Products makes sorting easy and further creates a connection between products and blog artciles.\n\nWhat do you like best about aheadWorks?\nIt works exactly like described and is very easy to install, simple to set up and use.  It includes all the essential features a blog plugin should offer, i.e., Category wise sorting, Tags, Related products, SEO, sharing buttons, and Disqus forums functionality.\n\nWhat do you dislike about aheadWorks?\nFor a multi-store setup, you cant use the same blog with a different view for each.  We are Canada based business, and a few of our blogs are not entirely suited for the US market. So we are forced to create a separate blog for US customers instead of showing a  modified version under different store/view.\n\nRecommendations to others considering aheadWorks:\nAnyone looking for blog modules for Magento which are easy to install, set up, and use, Aheadworks is the right choice. This module offers everything necessary for an e-commerce blog. You can create a connection between products and blogs or vice versa.\n\nWhat problems is aheadWorks solving and how is that benefiting you?\nCreating a connection between our products and the industry. Also, educating customers about product features using this robust tool.",
