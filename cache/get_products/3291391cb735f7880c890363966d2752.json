Because I feel it may be helpful to someone who wants to understand the subject. My case was I have already taken courses on machine learning and data science from coursera and also in my college curriculum. But never understood the full concept and was still diffident about my understanding. Then I decided to go for extra coaching and got to know about analytix labs. I took course of Datascience, initially I thought of skipping the python classes, as I believe to be very good in python, but in the classes I was taught several new things which I didn't know before, the instructor who was teaching us had 10+ years of experience and he shared a very good practical way to look into the things and gave reasons to most of the concepts which we were taught to just remember. The only thing which stopped me taking the course was their fees, and thats where you take the decision, There are already players in the market who are teaching more or less same at the half of the fees. But believe me, the quality here is much better than them. I had taken the same course before joining analytixlabs at the cheaper price and that guy did nothing more than reading from slides. I believe I knew much more than him. Anyways, here it is completely different from the very first class you would come to know what teaching actually means at analytixlabs.\nThanks",
