In the years of use we also added a lot of plugins that significantly improved our use of Atom.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Atom?\nHonestly i myself dont dislike anything about Atom. The only thing for me was the start of using Atom, it was a bit complicated at first because you have so many options you can trigger to make it your own.\n\nNo complaints! :)\n\nWhat problems is Atom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAtom has helped solve a lot of problems, the easy editing of text files, working fast and efficiently with the integrated Git plugin.

Therefore, if you are used to such extra features, you are going to miss in atom.\n\nWhat problems is Atom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nSo I coded on atom for pretty much every language and sometimes for just file editor. Mostly I used to code in python for my ML project as it doesnt eat up you ram and leaves a lot of space in ram for training the model.",

                "review_content": "What do you like best about Atom?\nAtom has a very simple GUI developed by GitHub, so it has a built-in git feature. It provides a decent amount of extensions and plugins to add more features for your convenience.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Atom?\nAtom does provide a very limited number of extensions, whereas VScode offers a vast number of extensions and customization. Atom is slower than some other text editors, and when you add more extensions and plugins, it worsens.\n\nWhat problems is Atom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt is a good text editor for someone who dislikes too many extensions, customization and adding on features. It has built-in git feature, which is very helpful while working on more significant projects.",

The user experience is consistent when I switch between Mac OS and Windows.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Atom?\nI guess not much. But if the CSS color code can be turned into a color preview inline, then will be a nice feature like other code editor does.\n\nWhat problems is Atom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs I am a cross-platform user switching between Mac OS and Windows OS, it's the only code editor that provides me with a consistent user experience and makes my work more productive without needing to remember different commands on a different platform.",
